Hay un número en particular que es interesante que es el 59 con el que tiene más similitud, 0.59 es el conocido como límite de Betz que hace referencia a la cantidad de energía disponible del viento para generación y es un límite teórico, es interesante pensar si esta relación es por esa razón o es casualidad.\n",
